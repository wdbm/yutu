Data by Dorit Borrmann and Hassan Afzal of Jacobs University Bremen gGmbH was provided by the [Robotic 3D Scan Repository](http://kos.informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de/3Dscans/). The data were recorded at the Automation Lab at Jacobs University Bremen using a Riegl VZ-400 laser scanner and an Optris PI infrared camera. Thermal data is encoded as colour.

# future

Under consideration are rigid body movement matrices and perspective projection data cuts.
